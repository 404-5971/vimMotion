# vimMotion

Just a plugin that add vim-like control in Discord, because I hate everything that doesn't include vim controls.

## Installation

Follow the instruction at : https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/
Once done, go on `Settings > Plugin`type `vimMotion" enable the plugin and voil√†, you've got yourself a bit of vim

## Usage

For now it only has one feature, you can scroll up or down using jk keys, just like in vim.

## Future improvements

- Add a tooltip to indicate which mode is enabled
- Jump from channel to channel using hl keys
- Jump from unread channel to unread channel using HL keys
- Impelement Replace mode
- Jump between servers using JK keys
- Add gg/GG to navigate from top to bottom of a channel
- add yy/dd/p utility
- add parameter to setup which mode is the default one when launching discord / Vesktop
